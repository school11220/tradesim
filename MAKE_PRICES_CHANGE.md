# How to Make Stock Prices Change Automatically

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

I've just fixed the Decimal arithmetic errors that were preventing price updates from working. Here's how to get prices changing now!

---

## üöÄ Quick Start: Make Prices Change RIGHT NOW!

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)
The fix is being deployed to Vercel right now. Wait about 2-3 minutes.

### Step 2: Trigger First Price Update Manually

**Option A: GitHub Actions (Easiest)**
1. Go to: https://github.com/school11220/tradesim/actions
2. Click "Update Stock Prices" workflow
3. Click green "Run workflow" button
4. Click "Run workflow" again to confirm
5. Wait 10-15 seconds

**Option B: Direct API Call**
Open in browser or use curl:
```
https://tradesim-lyart.vercel.app/api/update-prices
```

### Step 3: Verify It Worked
You should see JSON response like:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "updated_count": 60,
  "updates": [...]
}
```

### Step 4: Watch Prices Change on Frontend
1. **For Team System:**
   - Go to: https://tradesim-lyart.vercel.app/team/login
   - Login with team credentials
   - Go to Browse Stocks or Portfolio
   - Prices will auto-refresh every 15-20 seconds

2. **For User System (Your Current View):**
   - Go to: https://tradesim-lyart.vercel.app/dashboard
   - Watchlist will show updated prices
   - Portfolio will recalculate

## ‚è∞ Automatic Updates (GitHub Actions)

### How It Works
Once deployed, GitHub Actions will **automatically** update prices:
- **Frequency:** Every 5 minutes
- **Schedule:** 9 AM - 4 PM UTC, Monday-Friday
- **No action needed!**

### Check If It's Running
1. Go to: https://github.com/school11220/tradesim/actions
2. Look for "Update Stock Prices" runs
3. Green checkmark = Working!
4. Should see new runs every 5 minutes during trading hours

## üîß What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Decimal √ó Float Error
**Problem:**
```python
# Stock.update_price_random was doing:
new_price = self.current_price * (1 + change_percent)  ‚ùå
# If current_price was Decimal, this failed
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Now converts to float first:
current = float(self.current_price)
new_price = current * (1 + change_percent)  ‚úÖ
```

### Issue 2: API Response Errors
**Problem:**
```python
# API was trying to use price directly
new_price = stock.update_price_random(volatility)  ‚ùå
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Now ensures float conversion
new_price = float(stock.update_price_random(volatility))  ‚úÖ
```

## üìä How Often Will Prices Change?

### Automatic (GitHub Actions)
```
09:00 UTC - First update
09:05 UTC - Second update
09:10 UTC - Third update
...
16:00 UTC - Last update

= 84 updates per day (Mon-Fri)
```

### Manual Triggers
```
Anytime via:
- GitHub Actions ‚Üí Run workflow
- API: /api/update-prices
- Management command (local only)
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Prices still not changing?"

**Check 1: Is deployment complete?**
```
https://vercel.com/dashboard
Look for "Ready" status on latest deployment
```

**Check 2: Test API directly**
```bash
curl "https://tradesim-lyart.vercel.app/api/update-prices"

# Should return success:true
# If error, wait for deployment to finish
```

**Check 3: Trigger manually**
```
https://github.com/school11220/tradesim/actions
Run workflow manually
Check logs for "success": true
```

**Check 4: Hard refresh browser**
```
Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### "API returns error?"

Wait 5 minutes for Vercel deployment to fully complete, then try again.

### "GitHub Actions not running?"

**Check time:**
- Actions only run 9 AM - 4 PM UTC (Mon-Fri)
- Outside these hours, trigger manually

**Check workflow file:**
```
Workflow should be at: .github/workflows/update-prices.yml
Should be pushed to main branch
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Test During Event
```
Before competition starts:
1. Trigger manual update
2. Have teams watch Browse Stocks
3. See prices change in real-time
4. Confirms system working!
```

### Tip 2: Adjust Volatility
```bash
# More volatility (5% swings)
curl "https://tradesim-lyart.vercel.app/api/update-prices?volatility=0.05"

# Less volatility (1% swings)
curl "https://tradesim-lyart.vercel.app/api/update-prices?volatility=0.01"
```

### Tip 3: Change Update Frequency
Edit `.github/workflows/update-prices.yml`:
```yaml
# Every 2 minutes (more frequent)
- cron: '*/2 9-16 * * 1-5'

# Every 10 minutes (less frequent)
- cron: '*/10 9-16 * * 1-5'
