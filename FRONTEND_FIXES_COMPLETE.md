## What's Next?

The frontend is now fully functional with:
- âœ… Working real-time updates
- âœ… Fixed portfolio display
- âœ… Better UI/color scheme
- âœ… TradeSim branding

For production deployment, ensure:
1. The stock price updater command is running: `python manage.py update_stock_prices --continuous --interval 30`
2. Static files are collected: `python manage.py collectstatic`
3. Database has stocks initialized
4. ALLOWED_HOSTS includes your domain

## API Endpoint

The real-time updates use: `/team/api/stock-prices`

This returns JSON with current prices for all active stocks. Both browse stocks and portfolio pages poll this endpoint automatically.

**All Done! The frontend is now working beautifully with TradeSim branding! ðŸŽ‰**
