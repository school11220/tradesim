    - Records: timestamp, type (BUY/SELL), symbol, quantity, price, total

### 3. **Detailed Portfolio View** (`/team/portfolio`)
- **File**: `templates/main/team_portfolio.html`
- **View**: `app1.views.team_portfolio`
- **Features**:
  - Complete portfolio overview with 4 key metrics:
    - Total Portfolio Value (cash + holdings)
    - Available Cash
    - Holdings Value
    - Total Profit/Loss ($ and %)
  - **Holdings Table** showing for each stock:

---

## üîÑ Real-Time Admin Integration

### How It Works:
1. **Admin Updates Stock Price**:
   - Admin goes to Django admin panel
   - Selects stocks and uses "Update stock price" action
   - Enters new price (or uses "Set random prices")
   - Stock.current_price is updated in database

2. **Teams See Updated Prices Immediately**:
   - Stock browsing page fetches latest prices from Stock model
   - Trade page shows current market price
   - Portfolio automatically recalculates P/L based on new prices

3. **Profit/Loss Calculation**:
   ```python
   invested = avg_price * quantity
   current_value = current_price * quantity  # Uses latest price from admin
   profit_loss = current_value - invested
   profit_loss_percent = (profit_loss / invested) * 100
   ```

## üíæ Data Model Integration

### Team Model Fields Used:
```python
team.balance              # Cash available for trading
team.portfolio            # JSONField: {symbol: {quantity, avg_price}}
team.trade_history        # JSONField: [trade records]
team.total_trades         # Integer: count of all trades
team.last_trade_time      # Timestamp of most recent trade
team.portfolio_value      # Property: calculates total value
```

### Stock Model Fields Used:
```python
stock.symbol              # e.g., "AAPL"
stock.name                # e.g., "Apple Inc."
stock.current_price       # Admin-controlled price
stock.previous_close      # For calculating change
stock.price_change        # Calculated: current - previous
stock.price_change_percent  # Calculated percentage
stock.is_active           # Only show active stocks
```

---

## üßÆ Transaction Logic

### Buy Transaction:
1. Validate quantity > 0
2. Calculate total cost: `price * quantity`
3. Check balance: `total_cost <= team.balance`
4. Calculate new average price:
   ```python
   new_avg = ((current_qty * current_avg) + (new_qty * price)) / total_qty
   ```
5. Update portfolio: `team.portfolio[symbol] = {quantity, avg_price}`
6. Deduct balance: `team.balance -= total_cost`
7. Record trade in history
8. Save team

### Sell Transaction:
1. Validate quantity > 0
2. Check holdings: `quantity <= holding['quantity']`
3. Calculate revenue: `price * quantity`
4. Update portfolio:
   - If selling all: remove from portfolio
   - If partial: update quantity
5. Add to balance: `team.balance += revenue`
6. Record trade in history
7. Save team

## üéØ Key Formulas

### Average Price Calculation (Weighted):
```python
new_avg_price = ((existing_qty * existing_avg) + (new_qty * purchase_price)) / (existing_qty + new_qty)
```

### Profit/Loss:
```python
invested_value = average_price * quantity
current_value = current_price * quantity  # Current price from admin
profit_loss = current_value - invested_value
profit_loss_percent = (profit_loss / invested_value) * 100
```

### Portfolio Value:
```python
holdings_value = sum(stock.current_price * holding['quantity'] for all holdings)
portfolio_value = team.balance + holdings_value
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No stocks available"
**Solution**: Run `python init_db.py` to create 63 stocks

### Issue: "Event is not active"
**Solution**: Go to admin ‚Üí Events ‚Üí Change status to "in_progress"

### Issue: "Insufficient balance"
**Solution**: Check team.balance in admin, increase initial_capital in event settings

### Issue: Prices not updating
**Solution**: 
1. Check Stock.is_active = True in admin
2. Use admin action "Update stock price" not manual edit
3. Refresh team page after admin changes

### Issue: Can't sell stock
**Solution**: 
1. Verify team owns the stock in portfolio
2. Check quantity doesn't exceed holdings
3. Ensure event is still active
