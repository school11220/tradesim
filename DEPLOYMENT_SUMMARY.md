   - Look for "investa-eight" project
   - Check deployment status (should show "Ready")

2. **Test Team Login:**
   ```
   URL: https://investa-eight.vercel.app/team/login
   
   Use your team credentials to login
   ```

3. **Test Browse Stocks:**
   ```
   URL: https://investa-eight.vercel.app/team/stocks

## 📊 Database Status

**Production Database (Neon PostgreSQL):**
- ✅ 60 stocks initialized
- ✅ 2 simulator settings configured
- ✅ 1 active event
- ✅ 2 users/teams

**Important:** Stock prices in production are static until you run the price updater.

## ⚙️ Post-Deployment Tasks

### Optional: Enable Live Price Updates

If you want stock prices to change automatically in production, you'll need to run the price updater. This requires a persistent server (Vercel functions are serverless and timeout after 60 seconds).

**Options:**

1. **Railway/Render/DigitalOcean Worker:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py update_stock_prices --continuous --interval 30
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions (Scheduled):**
   Run every 5 minutes via cron job

3. **Keep it Static:**
   Manually update from admin panel when needed

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

After deployment completes (2-3 minutes), test:

- [ ] Team login page loads
- [ ] Browse stocks shows TradeSim branding
- [ ] Stock cards display correctly
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Portfolio page loads
- [ ] Summary cards show correct values
- [ ] Navigation menu works
- [ ] Mobile view is responsive
- [ ] Trade page still works
- [ ] Admin panel accessible

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If pages show old design:
1. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Clear browser cache**
3. **Wait for Vercel build to complete** (check Vercel dashboard)

### If getting 500 errors:
1. Check Vercel function logs in dashboard
2. Verify database connection string is correct
3. Check if migrations are needed

### If real-time updates not working:
- This is normal for first deployment
- Updates require the price updater to be running
- Stock prices are static until you run the updater or manually change in admin
