# Team Pages Loading Fix - October 16, 2025

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** When clicking "Browse Stocks" or "Portfolio" buttons, the page would reload but show blank/not load the actual content.

**Root Cause:** The `team_base.html` template had a double HTML structure:
1. It was extending `main/base.html` 
2. Then wrapping everything in `{% block website %}`
3. Then adding its own full `<!DOCTYPE html>` document

This created nested HTML documents which broke page rendering.

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### Fixed `templates/main/team_base.html`

**Before:**
```html
{% extends 'main/base.html' %}

{% block website %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    ...
</head>
<body>
    ...
</body>
</html>
{% endblock %}
```

**After:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    ...
</head>
<body>
    ...
</body>
</html>
```

## ✅ What Now Works

1. ✅ **Browse Stocks button** - Loads the stock browsing page with grid layout
2. ✅ **Portfolio button** - Loads the portfolio page with holdings
3. ✅ **Navigation menu** - All nav links work correctly
4. ✅ **Page rendering** - No more blank pages or infinite reloads
5. ✅ **Mobile menu** - Toggle functionality works

## 📝 Technical Details

**Why it happened:**
- Django's template inheritance doesn't support double extends
- `{% block website %}` was wrapping an entire HTML document inside another
- Browser received malformed nested HTML structure
- Pages failed to render properly

**The fix:**
- Made `team_base.html` a standalone template
- Removed the inheritance from `main/base.html`
- Removed the `{% block website %}` wrapper
- Now generates clean, single HTML document

## 🎯 Pages Affected (Now Fixed)

- ✅ `/team/stocks` - Browse Stocks page
- ✅ `/team/portfolio` - Portfolio page  
- ✅ `/team/trade/<symbol>` - Trading page
- ✅ All pages using `team_base.html`

**Fix deployed! Team pages now load correctly! 🎉**
