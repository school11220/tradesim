## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: About the VS Code "Errors"

The errors you see in VS Code are **NOT REAL ERRORS**. They are **false positives** from the linter.

### Why They Appear:
VS Code's CSS and JavaScript linters don't understand Django template syntax (`{% %}` and `{{ }}`).

### Why They Don't Matter:
Django processes templates **SERVER-SIDE** before sending to the browser:

**What VS Code sees:**
```javascript
const currentPrice = {{ stock.current_price }};  // ❌ Linter error
```

**What the browser actually receives:**
```javascript
const currentPrice = 150.50;  // ✅ Valid JavaScript
```

### Proof It Works:
- ✅ Deployment succeeded (14 seconds)
- ✅ Status shows "● Ready"
- ✅ Site is live and accessible
- ✅ All 7 files successfully deployed

**You can safely ignore these linter warnings!**

## 📦 Database Initialization (If Needed)

If you don't have stocks in your database yet:

### Option 1: Using Vercel CLI
```bash
vercel env pull .env.production
python3 init_db.py
```

### Option 2: Via Django Shell (on Vercel)
Go to your Vercel project → Settings → Functions → Click on your function → Logs

Or use this quick SQL (in your Neon database):
```sql
-- Create 5 quick test stocks
INSERT INTO app1_stock (symbol, name, sector, current_price, previous_close, is_active, last_updated) VALUES
('AAPL', 'Apple Inc.', 'Technology', 150.50, 145.00, true, NOW()),
('GOOGL', 'Alphabet Inc.', 'Technology', 2800.00, 2750.00, true, NOW()),
('MSFT', 'Microsoft Corp.', 'Technology', 380.25, 375.00, true, NOW()),
('AMZN', 'Amazon.com Inc.', 'Consumer', 3350.00, 3300.00, true, NOW()),
('TSLA', 'Tesla Inc.', 'Consumer', 725.50, 710.00, true, NOW());
